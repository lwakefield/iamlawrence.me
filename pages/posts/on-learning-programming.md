title: On Learning Programming

There are three reasons that an individual may wish to learn programming:

1. To build something
2. To make money
3. Because it seems interesting

Those who wish to build something are probably not reading this, because they
are off learning it themselves in whatever fashion allows them to start building
as fast as possible.

For those who wish to use programming as a skill to make themselves money -
power to you. I hope you find some benefit from these thoughts.

However, these thoughts are really for number three - those who think
programming might be interesting. I don't plan on giving you a prescription of
what it means to become a programmer, but instead hope to give some "starting
points" so that you can find out for yourself whether it is interesting or not.

Sidenote: Of course it is likely that there will be a mix of the three, and one reason
doesn't preclude you from another.

## Programming is easy

Well kind of. I think one mistake that a lot of new programmers make is by
trying to take the easiest path.

In the case of bootcamps, you are shown how to to make an application from
beginning to end, where the ending point is a url on the wider world web. This
is awesome. It is so cool that you are able to do something that twenty years
ago would have taken a team of experts - all within the space of 12 weeks.

I think this can give off the impression that programming is easy. We are
standing on the backs of giants. But if the giants move in a way that we don't
expect - we will fall off. Perhaps less metaphorically - it ignores the past 80
odd years of modern computing and the lessons learned along the way. Especially
considering how many of those lessons _are_ still relevant today.

The way I see it - learning to program should be done in two parts:

1. Learning how cool it is - focusing on the basics and what you can do with
   them
2. Exposing yourself to the vastness of the field of computers - which will
   teach you what you don't know and maybe entice you into a pasture

## Resources

Here are some resources which I think cover some ground:

- [The Learn Enough Series](https://www.learnenough.com/courses) focuses on
    "learning enough <blank> to be dangerous" and the idea that there is only a
    small subset of knowledge needed to get started
- [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts) covers
    all sorts of different computing topic - take your pick between things that
    seem interesting and things that you know nothing about. [Don't miss the
    compendium.](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium)
- Others have compiled long lists of long lists of resources
    [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Take a flick through to get
    a sense of what there is to know - for every new topic you find in your
    programming career, you will likely be able to find a list of related
    resources from here.
- [The C Programming
    Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) - this
    is _the_ classic book teaching the C programming language, and _the_ gold
    standard on technical writing.
- If you are interested in seeing what they teach in "real" schools - MIT hosts
    _a lot_ of content for free
